            <hr>
            <p class="text-wrap">The temple started initially as a thatched hut where Murugan's ardent devotee Annaswami Nayakar kept a portrait of the God and worshipped him. The temple was built on the same site as the thatched hut around 1890. He was the founder and the first priest of the temple. The Vadapalani temple became famous because of the Arul Vaakku and the ability to foretell events, as Annaswami Nayakar’s words carried the truth. The devotees believed his sacred words gave effective solutions to problems, including education, failure in examinations, marriage issues, ailments, and unemployment, among others. The disciple of Annaswami Nayakar, Rathinasamy Chettiyar continued the tradition and was blessed with the same divine energy and ability of Arul Vaakku. The temple underwent renovation in 1920, and over the past century, devotees throng the temple in huge numbers.<br>The temple was built in the late 19th century by an ardent devotee of Murugan, Annaswami Nayakar. He was a staunch devotee of Murugan and had built a small, thatched hut in which he placed a painted portrait of Murugan and started worshipping him. Although he suffered from an acute stomach- ailment, he went on a pilgrimage visiting all Murugan temples, braving bad weather, and thieves. One day, a Sadhu (sage) appeared in his dream and said Murugan was right in his home for worship. Annaswami Nayakar started offering poojas to Murugan, and on the word of a Palani Sadhu, he offered his tongue at the Thiruttani shrine of Murugan. His ailments disappeared.<br>One day he fulfilled his dream of visiting the southern Palani temple, and after Darshan (sacred view) of God, he was coming down the steps, when a beautiful picture of Murugan attracted his attention. He didn't have money to buy the picture. Next day, The shop keeper brought the picture to annaswami telling murugan came in his dream and asked to offer the painting. Annaswami bought this precious possession to his home in Chennai and asked the family to shift home elsewhere. Meanwhile, he experienced a divine power within him that started speaking truths (Arul Vaakku) and resolving problems of other devotees during pooja. His successor Rathinasamy Chettiyar agreed to Nayakar's wish to build a temple on the site.<br></p>
